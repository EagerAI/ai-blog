Welcome to our blog! Here you'll find the latest news, insights, and examples of using AI-related technologies (deep learning frameworks such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow), [Keras](https://github.com/rstudio/keras), and [torch](https://torch.mlverse.com), as well as distributed-computing and automation-related frameworks like [sparklyr](https://github.com/sparklyr/sparklyr) and [mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)) from R.
